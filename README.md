<h1>Notes</h1>
This game is so incomplete i have only finished the basics so i don't think a video is needed since
there's nothing really to show, i'll probably finish it next week.
**<h1>Note To Reviewer</h1>**
I added a screenshot somewhere in the repo which shows the environment i made and stuff,
That's all i added to the game since i didn't have time to add anything else but the basics,
So i just added some screenshots instead of a dmeo video.
